# Mug-and-Spoon (Challenge-3)

## Description

This files are created to complete the Module three challenge-3

I want to be able to generate a password for users so that they can have good security.

Now the client should be able to easily generate a new password rather than making it themselves.

I learned about layers of functions, for loops, and if statements snd the orders they must be placed in inorder to function.
